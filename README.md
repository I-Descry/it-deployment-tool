# IT Deployment Tool

A modular PowerShell-based deployment tool designed to automate application installation and simplify the setup of new Windows devices.

Instead of manually downloading and installing applications one at a time, the tool provides a single interactive interface for selecting and processing multiple applications. It reduces repetitive work, saves deployment time, minimizes manual errors, and helps maintain a consistent device setup process.

## Application Configuration

Applications are configured inside:

```text
Config/Applications.json
```

Each application entry defines information such as:

- Application name
- Detection name
- Installation type
- WinGet package ID or offline installer path
- Silent installation arguments
- Accepted success exit codes
- Restart exit codes
- Category
- Description
- Recommended status

Example WinGet application:

```json
{
  "Name": "Google Chrome",
  "DetectionName": "Google Chrome",
  "InstallType": "Winget",
  "WingetId": "Google.Chrome",
  "Category": "Browsers",
  "Description": "Google Chrome web browser",
  "Recommended": true
}
```

Example offline EXE application:

```json
{
  "Name": "SAP GUI for Windows 7.70",
  "DetectionName": "SAP GUI for Windows 7.70",
  "InstallType": "Exe",
  "InstallerPath": "SAPGUI-7.70-WINDOWS_50152942_2\\BD_NW_7.0_Presentation_7.70_Comp._1_\\PRES1\\GUI\\Windows\\Win32\\SapGuiSetup.exe",
  "SilentArguments": "",
  "SuccessExitCodes": [0, 129],
  "RebootExitCodes": [129],
  "Category": "Company Applications",
  "Description": "SAP GUI client used by the company",
  "Recommended": true
}
```

## Offline Installers

Offline installer files are stored inside the `Installers` directory.

These files are excluded from the Git repository because they may be:

- Large
- Proprietary
- Licensed
- Company-specific

After cloning the repository, required offline installer files must be manually placed inside the `Installers` directory using the folder structure configured in `Applications.json`.

Example:

```text
Installers/
└── SAPGUI-7.70-WINDOWS_50152942_2/
    └── BD_NW_7.0_Presentation_7.70_Comp._1_/
        └── PRES1/
            └── GUI/
                └── Windows/
                    └── Win32/
                        └── SapGuiSetup.exe
```

---

## Deployment Logs

Deployment logs are automatically created inside:

```text
Logs/
```

Each session creates a separate `.log` file containing:

- Tool version
- Computer name
- Logged-in user
- Session start time
- Application processing results
- Installation summary
- Session completion time

Generated log files are excluded from Git.

---

## Running the Tool

Open PowerShell in the project directory and run:

```powershell
.\Start.ps1
```

The tool automatically requests administrator privileges when elevation is required.

---

## Typical Workflow

1. Start the deployment tool.
2. Review the displayed system information and status checks.
3. Open the Install Applications menu.
4. Select applications individually, select all, or select recommended applications.
5. Preview the recommended setup when needed.
6. Start the installation queue.
7. Review the installation summary.
8. Open Deployment Logs to inspect session activity.

## Purpose

This project was created to improve the consistency and efficiency of Windows device deployment by combining application selection, installation automation, installed-application detection, offline installer support, recommended setup workflows, and deployment logging into one modular PowerShell tool.
