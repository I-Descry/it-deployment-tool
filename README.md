# IT Deployment Tool

A modular PowerShell-based deployment tool created to automate application installation when setting up new Windows devices.

Instead of manually downloading and installing each application one by one, the tool allows me to select multiple required applications and install them automatically through a single interface. This reduces repetitive work, saves deployment time, minimizes human effort, and helps me make future device setups more consistent.

## Offline Installers

Offline installer files are stored inside the `Installers` directory.

These files are excluded from the Git repository because they may be large, proprietary, or company-specific. After cloning the project, the required installer folders and files must be placed manually inside `Installers`.

Example:

```text
Installers/
└── SAPGUI-7.70-WINDOWS_50152942_2/
    └── ...
        └── SapGuiSetup.exe
